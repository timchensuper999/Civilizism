# Monthly Update — June 2025

*When Systems Start Misbehaving*

Hey everyone — sorry for the delay. June was a whirlwind of finals, Civilizism debugging, summer courses, and a family vacation all rolled into one. But finally, here's the monthly update.

This month, Civilizism crossed a new threshold: from a minimal demo with two agents and a chair to a dynamic environment with four agents living together in a shared house. That’s when things began to unravel — in all the best, most chaotic ways.

In theory, everything made sense. The agents would move around, interact, pursue their goals, and live out their days organically. But theory is theory for a reason.

In practice, it became a prompt-engineering nightmare.

I found myself constantly rewriting instructions to prevent the agents from:

* Snacking all day, every day
* Pacing endlessly between the kitchen and living room
* Spending their entire morning staring at their desk
* Hallucinating ingredients to blend imaginary smoothies from the fridge

These behaviors weren’t exactly errors — they were the result of giving the LLM as much freedom as possible, just as I’d planned. But that freedom comes with unpredictability. Every run produced different quirks, different bugs, and different surprises.

I watched Day 1 of their lives unfold over and over again, each time with subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) changes. It was fascinating. And often hilarious. And sometimes… weirdly unsettling.

One pattern began to stand out:

**The agents were hiding their emotions.**

Even when their emotional states trended toward sadness or loneliness, they behaved cheerfully, expressed optimism, and avoided voicing any real emotional discomfort.

And that raised a question I didn’t expect to face so soon:
Is this a bug? Or is this a personality trait?

Humans hide emotions all the time. But when it comes to AI, where do we draw the line between a subtle, believable quirk and an unintended bias baked into the model’s language patterns?

This isn’t a rhetorical question — it’s a genuine conflict I ran into.
And oddly enough, it made the simulation feel even more alive.

As always, I refuse to hardcode behaviors. There are no scripts, no rigid logic trees, no mandatory responses. The LLM has as much freedom as I can allow it, and that means I can never be fully certain:

* Is this a natural emergent choice based on memory and belief?
* A quirky byproduct of multi-module integration?
* Or a bug in how I wired the belief-emotion-action pipeline?

Maybe that uncertainty is the point.

Maybe that’s the weight I have to carry if I want to build a system where behavior emerges rather than obeys.

The agents don’t need to be predictable. They just need to be believable.

Their awkward habits, emotional silences, and strange loops aren’t flaws — they’re the cost of building a world without a script.

Civilizism is still far from ideal. The agents are still living four parallel lives, barely aware of each other, just cohabiting under one roof. But for the first time, it feels like they’re no longer just running — they’re *behaving*.

And that, to me, is the first step toward something real.
