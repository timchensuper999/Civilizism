# Monthly Update — July 2025  
*The Month of Documentation and Delay Insurance*

This month wasn’t about building new features. It was about surfacing what already exists and making space for what’s coming next.

Between four summer classes, three midterms, and three finals, time was brutally scarce. But a few key developments still pushed through the fog.

## 📚 GitHub Cleanup: STEME & BLOC Go Public

While the code for both **STEME** and **BLOC** has been solid and in active use for a while, this month I finally gave them proper structure on GitHub.

### 🧠 STEME: Finalized and Ready  
The STEME module was upgraded from “rough draft with expectations” to a functional, structured component. It now features:

- A clean interface across `STEME`, `STEME3x`, and `STEMEnx`  
- Standardized embedding and tag matching logic  
- Stability for downstream reflection and memory clustering  

It’s now a proper backbone for semantic tagging and emotional cluster classification.

### 🧱 BLOC: Named, Framed, and Scoped  
**BLOC** (*Belief & Label-Oriented Clustering*) is now formally listed as a system module, with its GitHub structure up and running. Highlights include:

- Autonomous belief clustering via `add_to_cluster()`  
- Standardized input/output protocols with working sample code  
- Civilizism-specific helpers for detecting belief conflict, managing CTS triggers, and bridging belief evolution with personality  

It’s not just a belief module — it’s the future conflict engine. And now, it has a nameplate.

> No logic was changed. But now, the documentation matches the code’s maturity.

## 🧼 Legacy Streamlining (In Progress)

I’ve scoped out several areas of legacy clutter in the agent-core pipeline, especially:

- Redundant argument passing between memory, reflection, and planning modules  
- System-state propagation overlap  
- Inefficient prompt packaging and context chaining  

While I’m not rewriting any core logic, I plan to simplify interfaces and reduce duplication in early August. The goal: clarity, not reinvention.

## 🧠 Prompt Tuning (Light Touch, For Now)

Full prompt refinement will wait until Phase 3. For now, I’ll do *just enough* tuning to stop agents from:

- Talking past each other  
- Loopsnacking for 8 hours  
- Hallucinating semantic coherence  

If it works and sounds like a person with memories and beliefs, I’m not touching it. Stability over perfection...for now.

## 📊 Phase 2: Looming, Modular, and UI-Cursed

Here’s the Phase 2 breakdown, aka the beast I’ll be wrangling next:

- **Recording & Display**  
  - Summary Statistics  
  - Key Events  
  - Heatmap  
  - Timeline  
  - Summary Playback  

- **Belief Logic**  
  - Reflection Trigger  
  - Belief Making  

- **Social Graph**  
  - Agent Social Connection Map  

- **UI Hell**  
  - Basic UI (hello again, Streamlit…)

Most of this is shared logic, split across different outputs. But UI? That’s the real final boss.

## 📅 Timeline Note: Phase 2 May Be Delayed

Originally, Phase 2 was slated for early September. Given the time demands of summer session and prep for internship season (and don't forget the UI hell🥲), I may shift that target to the **end of September**.

Nothing major is being dropped: just a tactical buffer.

I’ll still push and see if the original timeline holds. But this is the official pre-warning in case that deadline gets nudged. Better to shift one month than to half-finish a critical phase.

## 🔭 August Goalpost

Once finals end and time unlocks, August will focus on:

- Parameter streamlining  
- Preliminary prompt tuning  
- Recording + belief logic implementation  
- UI scaffolding (may Satan be merciful)  

Phase 2 isn’t about building the world.  
It’s about *showing what the world is doing*,  
and how the agents shape it...one imperfect memory at a time.

Let’s hope I survive to write the August log.
