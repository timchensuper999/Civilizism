## 🧠 Agent Dialogue Milestone Achieved (Phase 0 Progress)

Agents can now **speak to each other in simulation!**  
We’ve implemented a functioning turn-based agent interaction system, where agents alternate actions and generate natural-language utterances based on memory and context.

### 💬 What works:
- ✅ Turn-based simulation with one agent acting per tick
- ✅ Memory-aware prompts to generate context-rich language
- ✅ Dialogue logs that are human-readable and easy to debug
- ✅ Reusable, scalable simulation loop for future multi-agent expansion

### 📌 Known Quirk (hilariously realistic)

While agents *technically* respond to each other, they sometimes exhibit what we call **"simulated soliloquy syndrome"** — a tendency to monologue while pretending to engage. This results in beautifully structured, emotionally intelligent... parallel monologues. Dialogue grounding logic is on the roadmap for refinement.

### 🪞 Observed Behavior:
- Agents propose emotionally rich ideas
- Agents completely ignore each other’s actual questions
- Dialogue continuity = 0%, but vibes = 100%

It’s like watching two AI therapists trying to out-validate each other without listening.

### 🔧 Next Steps:
- Implement response alignment scoring (did you answer the last question?)
- Add lightweight `question_detection()` in prompt parsing
- Tune LLM prompts to enforce reply-before-pivot rule
- Consider giving chairs emotional feelings if ignored long enough 🪑
