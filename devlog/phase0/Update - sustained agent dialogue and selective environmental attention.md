## 🧠 Phase 0 Expansion – Sustained Dialogue and Selective Environmental Attention

Agents can now maintain **multi-turn, emotionally coherent conversations**!

This milestone marks an evolution beyond simple turn-based speaking:
- Agents now actively **build upon previous conversational turns**
- Dialogue themes (e.g., emotional openness, troubleshooting) persist and deepen naturally
- Context recall (e.g., referencing childhood stories) enriches interaction quality
- Agents selectively **prioritize social engagement over environment** (e.g., ignoring System prompt about the lonely chair)

---

### 📜 Example Interaction:

1. **AgentA** notices AgentB helping others and asks about their experience.
2. **AgentB** connects troubleshooting success to **emotional openness**.
3. **AgentA** reflects and proposes that **vulnerability aids connection** during problem-solving.
4. **AgentB** probes further into **AgentA’s personal history** about emotional openness.

Result:  
✅ Sustained topic continuity  
✅ Mutual thematic development  
✅ Emotional resonance  
✅ Natural question chaining

---

### 🔧 Technical Improvements:
- Refined dialogue prompting to prioritize direct response + thematic continuation
- Relaxed forced environmental interaction unless socially disengaged
- Encouraged emotional memory retrieval in dialogue flow

---

### 🪑 Note:
System reminders about `chair_1` being lonely were **consciously deprioritized** by agents in favor of ongoing meaningful social interaction — demonstrating emergent **selective attention** behaviors.

> "Poor chair, sacrificed for the greater good of emotional depth."
